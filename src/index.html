    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>Highly motivated Michigan Undergrad who is eager to seek and gain knowledge in the engineering technology field. Currently pursuing a degree in computer engineering who is actively improving and developing skills as a leader and innovator. My core three passions are:
      - Creating innovative solutions to change the world for the better
      - Outreach for Youth and Education (i.e mentorship, tutoring, etc)
      - Entrepreneurial ventures
      In a constantly evolving world, I believe it is important to continue to make people's lives more efficient by creating products and services to do just that. Youth outreach is important to me because the children are the future. If we nurture our children at a young age and provide them with the insight of various careers and industries, they would easily pick up where we left off and possibly create an even better future. Lastly, Entrepreneurship endeavours. I believe in supporting the growth of our economy and who else better to do so than entreprenuers. They continue to create jobs, services, and products that keeps the economy up and running.
